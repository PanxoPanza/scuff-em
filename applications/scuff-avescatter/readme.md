# scuff-avescatter
This is the scuff-avescatter application for orientation-and-polarization-averaged scattering simulations

More info in [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14799v3)

Currently, this application retrieves the average absorption cross section, scatering cross section, and asymmetry parameter.
To run it, simply do
scuff-avescatter --geometry scuff_geometry_file.scuffgeo --OmegaFile some_omega_file
